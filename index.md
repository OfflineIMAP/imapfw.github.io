## imapfw

[OfflineIMAP organization]({{ links.offlineimap.organization }}) is born years ago to support the development of the OfflineIMAP software. OfflineIMAP is a python program included in all major open source distributions *(Debian, Ubuntu, RedHat, Slackware, Gentoo, Archlinux, etc)*. Since [some months]({{ site.base }}/development/2015/10/08/imapfw-is-made-public.html), the [imapfw project](https://github.com/OfflineIMAP/imapfw) was started to become the next generation tool with [a new approach](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3gpqqs_introduce-imapfw-syncaccounts_tech) and [extended features](https://gist.github.com/nicolas33/003f1b7184c7dfb26192).
